        <h2>LadyNerds Member F.A.Q.</h2>

            <span class="question">Where can I find out about LadyNerds events?</span>
            <p>
                <!-- FIXME: Add link to google calendar -->
                We have a Google calendar with upcoming events. Members are always welcome 
                (and encouraged!) to plan events and add them to the calendar. In addition,
                many events are posted to the #events Slack channel.
            </p>

            <span class="question">How do I add events to the calendar?</span>
            <p>
                <!-- FIXME: Add link to calender usage instructions -->
                The easiest way to add events to the calendar is to create an event on your google
                calendar and then add hackbrightladynerds@gmail.com as a guest to that event.
                For more detailed information see the <i>LadyNerds shared calendar usage instructions</i>
                document in the LadyNerds google drive.
            </p>

            <span class="question">How can I get more involved with LadyNerds?</span>
            <p>
                Our Slack community has over 200 members, is a forum for a wide range of conversations, 
                both technical and not, and is a great way to get to know other LadyNerds. There are channels 
                for a wide variety of interests: arts/crafts, career help, events, fashion, food, housing, 
                jobs, mental health, non-tech books, privilege, tech help, travel, and more.

                We hold regular board meetings and all members are welcome to attend. For details 
                about upcoming meetings, watch for announcements on the LadyNerds email list, or 
                join the boardmtngs_classreps Slack channel.
            </p>

            <span class="question">Do you have a code of conduct?</span>
            <p>
                <!-- FIXME: Add link to COC -->
                We do! All members who participate in LadyNerds agree to abide by our code.
            </p>

            <span class="question">Someone is violating the code of conduct -- what should I do?</span>
            <p>
                On Slack, if you type "moderator please" a slackbot will alert the moderators.
                You may also alert the moderators via DM.  If a COC violation occurs on the listserve
                you can either contact the moderators through Slack, or by emailing them.
