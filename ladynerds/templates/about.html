            Welcome to Lady Nerds! We are a professional network of over two hundred women 
            in technology in the Bay Area and beyond. Our members are alumnae of the Hackbright 
            Academy fellowship in software engineering, although Lady Nerds as an organization is 
            not affiliated with Hackbright.
        </p>

            Our mission is to empower women in technology through continued career development, 
            enriching connections, and responsible representation.  We strive to be a community-driven 
            support system for those with the shared experience of completing Hackbright or otherwise 
            equivalent program.

        <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
        <b>I'm actively recruiting women and would like to hire some Ladynerds. How?</b>
        <b>I'm organizing a conference and reaching out for diverse speakers. How?</b>
        <b>How can I get more involved with Lady Nerds?</b>
        <p>
            Our Slack community has over 200 members, is a forum for a wide range of conversations, 
            both technical and not, and is a great way to get to know other Lady Nerds. There are channels 
            for a wide variety of interests: arts/crafts, career help, events, fashion, food, housing, 
            jobs, mental health, non-tech books, privilege, tech help, travel, and more.

            We hold regular board meetings and all members are welcome to attend. For details 
            about upcoming meetings, watch for announcements on the Lady Nerds email list, or 
            join the boardmtngs_classreps Slack channel.

        <b>Where can I find out about Lady Nerds events?</b>
        <p>
            <!-- FIXME: Add link to google calendar -->
            We have a Google calendar with upcoming events. Members are always welcome 
            (and encouraged!) to plan events and add them to the calendar. In addition,
            many events are posted to the #events Slack channel.
        </p>

        <b>How do I add events to the calendar?</b>
        <p>
            <!-- FIXME: Add link to calender usage instructions -->
            The easiest way to add events to the calendar is to create an event on your google
            calendar and then add hackbrightladynerds@gmail.com as a guest to that event.
            For more detailed information see the <i>Lady Nerds shared calendar usage instructions</i>
            document in the LadyNerds google drive.

        <b>Do you have a code of conduct?</b>
        <p>
            <!-- FIXME: Add link to COC -->
            We do! All members who participate in Lady Nerds agree to abide by our code.
        </p>

        <b>Someone is violating the code of conduct -- what should I do?</b>
        <p>
            On Slack, if you type "moderator please" a slackbot will alert the moderators.
            You may also alert the moderators via DM.  If a COC violation occurs on the lsitserve
            you can either contact the moderators through Slack, or by emailing them.
