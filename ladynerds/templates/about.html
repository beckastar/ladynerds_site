            Welcome to LadyNerds! We are a professional network of over two hundred women 
            in technology in the Bay Area and beyond. Our members are alumnae of the Hackbright 
            Academy fellowship in software engineering, although LadyNerds as an organization is 
            not affiliated with Hackbright.

            Our mission is to empower women in technology through continued career development, 
            enriching connections, and responsible representation.  We strive to be a community-driven 
            support system for those with the shared experience of completing Hackbright or otherwise 
            equivalent program.

        <span class="question">I'm actively recruiting women and would like to hire some LadyNerds. How?
        I'm organizing a conference and reaching out for diverse speakers. How?
        How can I get more involved with LadyNerds?</span>
        <p>
            Our Slack community has over 200 members, is a forum for a wide range of conversations, 
            both technical and not, and is a great way to get to know other LadyNerds. There are channels 
            for a wide variety of interests: arts/crafts, career help, events, fashion, food, housing, 
            jobs, mental health, non-tech books, privilege, tech help, travel, and more.

            We hold regular board meetings and all members are welcome to attend. For details 
            about upcoming meetings, watch for announcements on the LadyNerds email list, or 
            join the boardmtngs_classreps Slack channel.
