# ladynerds_site

Ladynerds are an organization comprised of women who graduated from the Hackbright Academy coding bootcamp.  There are roughly 300 of us working in a variety of roles within the tech industry, primarily in San Francisco, but in other locations as well. 

This CRUD webapp is a collective project that will have the following features as part of the MVP:

- Display all users and skills 
- Google Cal integration:   https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/quickstart/python#prerequisites
- Good UI


We've chosen to use the old terminal color scheme of green on a black background.  

The green color hex value: #00ff00
The terminal font is in google fonts: https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/VT323

Nice to haves:
- Slack integration 

Currently has:
- Login /logout 
- About page url 
- Profile page
- working navbar 

## How to Contribute:

Fork the repo (there's a button in the upper right part of your screen)
- This makes a copy of the repo on your github
- It makes it so you can push up changes without needing to be an official/listed contributor

Clone repo:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/[your-username-here]/ladynerds_site.git ladynerds_site
$ cd ladynerds_site
```

We're currently working off of the 'static' branch, so check that out:
```sh
$ git checkout static
```
* (changes to this README should be done in master)

If that doesn't work (because you only have a master branch, locally), try:
```sh
$ git checkout --track origin/static
```
Acvtivate a virtual environment and install dependencies:
```sh
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After you've installed Django:

$ python manage.py runserver

And now you can view the site locally at http://localhost:8000/

Before you can sync any changes with the orginal repo, [configure your remote]

*substitute "static" for "master" if updates are in that branch
